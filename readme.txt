== Description ==

Add Google Analytics (GA), Google GTag, Facebook Pixel Tracking and custom JavaScript to your Web site quickly and easily. You can also Disable Admin Tracking and keep track of your website deployment using our best practices checklist.  The idea is to combine a lot of other plugins into one simple plugin that you should use on every site to follow best practices.  Have ideas or suggestions?  Let us know and we'll add them in future versions.
